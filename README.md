# Substitution-CS50
Code made for week 2 of CS50. The code encrypts a text, based on a key of 26 scrambled letters.

(On the CS50 Website) A key, for example, could be the string NQXPOMAFTRHLZGECYJIUWSKDVB. This 26 character key means that A(the first letter of the alphabet) must be converted to N(the first character of the key), B(the second letter of the alphabet) must be converted to Q(the second character of the key), and so on.
